Philosophy: Don't imitate, understand!  
Not just focus on what, but how and why
## Big words  
**Command Line Interface (CLI):** Type commands to your computer rather than clicking.  
**Micro processors:** very small machine that does a job. It speaks an specific language. It is a physical thing that accept instructuions.  
**Machine code:** programming languages spoken by computer processors.  
**Ecmascript:** The standard javascript is based on. It says how Javascript should work. It is also known as the standard for Javascript.  
**Javascript Engine:** A program that converts Javascript code into something the computer processor can understand.  
**V8:** It is a Google's open source JavaScript written in C++.  
**NodeJS:** It is a server technology.   
## Foundamental Knowledge  
V8 Engine is the javascript engine (The core of NodeJS). NodeJS expand the javascript code because you can write server code.  
* The better you know Javascript, the better you know NodeJS.  
* Node is written in C ++ because Javascript engine is written in C++.  
## Servers and clients
**Server:** computer that is performing services. It does the work.  
**Client:** Makes request to a server.  
## Modules, exports and requires  
**Module:** Reusable block of code.  
**First-class function:** Everything you can do with other types, you can do with functions.  
**Inheritance:** one object gets access to the properties and methods of another object.  
**Prototype chain:** A sequence of objects connected to each other and I can access to any object in the chain.
**Primitive:** A type of data that represents a single value.  
**Scope:** Where in code you have access to particular variable or function.  
## Event and event Emitter  
Event : something that has happening in our app that we can respond to. In node there are two types of events:
    * System Events: They come from C++ core, exactly from libuv.
    * Custome Events: They come inside javascript events. They are made by myself. It comes from Event Emiter.
